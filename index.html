                        We had a couple of leftover wraps that I made yesterday. They were a bit hard but still tasted good!<br>
                        I didn't feel like making more (and it was healthier without them) so I prepared just the contents of the wraps!<br>
                    </p>
                    <h6>Changes I made:</h6>
                    <p>
                        The lentils called for lentils, turmeric, coriander, cumin red pepper flakes, tomato paste, garlic, and olive oil.<br>
                        I didn't use coriander, cumin, or red pepper flakes.<br>
                        I used about a cup of green lentils and a cup of red lentils (that's what I had!)<br>
                        <br>
                        I changed the salad quite a bit; I basically made a pico de gallo with added feta and without the coriander (my boyfriend isn't a massive fan!).<br>
                        So, I just used three tomatoes, half a cucumber, a red onion, the juice of half a lime, half a block of feta, and a big sprinkle of salt.<br>
                        <br>
                        I chose to make the yoghurt sauce from the ones listed on the recioe site. <br>
                        The original recipe called for lemon juice, I used the juice of half a lime.<br>
                        Instead of the parsley (which I didn't have), I used about a tablespoon and a half of dried dill.

                        <h6>Next time...</h6>
                        <p>
                            Use only green lentils.
